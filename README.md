how-many-fingers-computer.html is a simple game where the user chooses between 0 and 5 "fingers" and the program guesses it. It also displays how many tries it took the program to guess that number.

how-many-fingers-user.html is the reverse of how-many-fingers-computer.html. Here the program generates a number between 0 and 5 corresponding to the number of "fingers" it is holding up and the user is expected to guess the number in as many tries as the user wants - the program will tell you when the user has got the right answer.

reaction-tester.html tests and trains a user's reflexes. A random shape in a random color and size will appear in any part of the window every 2 seconds. The user is expected to click on the shape to make it disappear as quickly as possible. The time it took the user to click on each shape every time is displayed on the screen.
